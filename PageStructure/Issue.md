# Issues found in the PageStructure/His Delivery code

## 1. Misuse of Next.js Features
- Entire pages are implemented as client-side components, ignoring the benefits of React Server Components (RSC) and server-side rendering.
- Loader components (e.g., Loader.jsx) are not used as intended; loading states are handled inefficiently.

## 2. Poor Layout and Structure
- No separate layout for members, despite this being required by the design and best practices.
- Layout files are missing or not used to organize and separate concerns between different user roles or sections.

## 3. Lack of Component Reusability
- The graph component on the dashboard is hardcoded and not designed for reuse (e.g., not reused in the analytics page).
- Components are tightly coupled to specific pages, making them difficult to maintain or extend.

## 4. Code Quality and Best Practices
- Mixing of concerns within pages; logic, data fetching, and UI are not separated.
- Inconsistent or missing use of modern Next.js conventions (e.g., app directory structure, server/client boundaries).

## 5. Maintainability and Readability
- Lack of comments and documentation.
- File and folder naming is inconsistent, making navigation harder.

These issues are evident when comparing the 'His Delivery' and 'Our Improvement' folders, which show improved structure, reusability, and adherence to Next.js best practices.
