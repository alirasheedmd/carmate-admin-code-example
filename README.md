## Repository Overview

This repository documents the Carmate Admin Panel codebase, structured to clearly demonstrate the shortcomings of the original delivery by the previous developer and the improvements made by our team. It is intended as evidence for an Upwork dispute regarding code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## Structure

- **Components/**  
  Contains UI components, with both the original ("His Delivery") and improved ("Our Improvements") versions for direct comparison.

- **PageStructure/**  
  Contains the application's page structure, split into:
  - **His Delivery/**: The original implementation by the previous developer, highlighting issues and anti-patterns.
  - **Our Improvement/**: Our refactored version, following modern React and Next.js conventions, best practices, and improved maintainability.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Compare Approaches:** Review files in both `His Delivery` and `Our Improvement` folders to see the differences in code quality, structure, and reusability.
- **Understand Issues:** See [PageStructure/Issue.txt](PageStructure/Issue.txt) and [Components/Issues.txt](Components/Issues.txt) for detailed documentation of the main problems found in the original code.
- **Best Practices:** Improved components and pages follow modern React and Next.js best practices, including server-side data fetching, component reusability, accessibility, and proper layout structure.

## Purpose

This repository serves as clear documentation and evidence for the Upwork dispute, providing a side-by-side comparison that highlights the deficiencies of the original delivery and the steps taken to correct them. It demonstrates our commitment to code quality, maintainability, and professional standards.
