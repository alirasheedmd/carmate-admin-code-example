// Issues found in the Components/Delivery code:

1. Graphs/Delivery/PerformanceCard.tsx
   - Hardcoded chart data and labels; not reusable for other datasets.
   - No prop for passing dynamic chart data; tightly coupled to a specific use case.
   - Uses "use client" for the entire component, even though only parts require client-side logic.
   - Lacks clear separation of concerns; UI, data, and logic are mixed.
   - No comments or documentation for maintainability.

2. Select/Delivery/Zul-Select.jsx
   - Custom select implementation re-invents basic select logic instead of using a well-tested library.
   - Lacks accessibility features (no ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, or focus management).
   - Uses internal state for value management, which can cause issues in controlled forms.
   - Error handling is minimal and only visual.

3. Form-Images/Delivery/CreateListingsModal.tsx
   - The images gallery is hardcoded and not reusable as a component.
   - No drag-and-drop functionality or image management features are implemented.
   - Lacks modularity, making it difficult to extend or use elsewhere in the application.
